My work experience started as PHP developer at Hutchinson Porto IT department. There I developed a small Manufacturing Execution System and other internal applications. I also helped to manage the on-site infrastructure of the company working with VMware and Windows Server.

When I joined Critical Manufacturing, I started to work with .NET, C# and SQL in the Product Team working in one of the most advanced MES in the world.
After some months, I joined the Deployment Services area (former Product Implementation) to work in projects for Critical Manufacturing customers. Here, I started to touch with infrastructure, to help the customers preparing the servers for the MES installation using SQL Server, Windows Server, Windows Failover Cluster, IIS.

Started as Junior developer, trying to learn the most from the best, then promoted to Senior Developer, Technical Lead and was also invited to join the OnCall Support team.
During these 5 years, I worked in projects mostly for factories of Medical Devices and SMT.

In 2019, together with 2 other colleagues, we created a DevOps team to improve and standardise all tools and pipelines used in Azure DevOps Services by all projects in the Deployment Services area. This team marked a shift in my career, because I found  out what I really like to do and what challenges me everyday: improve every process in a deployment, starting from the Developer Experience, ending with the final approval of the Deployment.

Our latest project was to build a CLI (is open-source you can check it [here](https://github.com/criticalmanufacturing/cli)), that decouples the need of Azure DevOps, to build a deployment package, to be installed in Critical Manufacturing Framework. We also started to develop some plugins to improve the developer experience.
